## Purpose :

The `lib` directory generally contains code that is more "library"-like — reusable pieces of functionality that could be considered a core part of the application. It might contain more complex modules or libraries that encapsulate a specific feature or domain of functionality.

## Example :

```
lib/
  ├── auth.js            # Authentication logic
  ├── paymentGateway.js  # Logic for processing payments
  ├── database.js        # Database interaction logic
```

- Core application logic, such as handling authentication, interacting with APIs, or managing sessions.
- Business logic modules, such as processing payments or managing user roles.
- Integration with external libraries or services (e.g., sending emails, connecting to a database).

## Usage :

Code in the `lib` directory is typically more substantial than in `utils`, as it's often central to the application's functionality. This is where you might keep your primary code that supports a specific feature of the project, which might also be shared or reused across different parts of the application.
