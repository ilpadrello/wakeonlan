# TOOLS

### Purpose:

Code under the tools directory usually contains scripts or utilities designed to perform specific tasks that assist with development, deployment, or other project workflows.

### Examples:

- Build tools (e.g., Webpack or Gulp configuration).
- Deployment scripts (e.g., deployment automation scripts).
- Development environment setup (e.g., Docker configurations, CI/CD scripts).
- Database migrations or seeding scripts.

### Usage:

The tools directory typically holds project-specific functionality that helps manage or automate various aspects of project maintenance.
These scripts aren't directly involved in the main application code but assist with running, managing, or preparing the project for use.

### Example

```
tools/
├── build.js # Script for building your project
├── deploy.js # Script for deployment
├── migrate.js # Database migration script
```
