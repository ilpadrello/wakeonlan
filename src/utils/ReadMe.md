# UTILS FOLDER

## Purpose :

The `utils` (short for "utilities") directory holds small, reusable functions or modules that provide general-purpose functionality. These are often utility functions that are used across the application.

## Examples :

```
utils/
  ├── formatDate.js      # Function to format dates
  ├── calculateAge.js    # Function to calculate age
  ├── validateEmail.js   # Function to validate email addresses
```

- Helper functions for formatting dates or strings.
- Functions for data validation, like checking if a number is within a valid range.
- Small general-purpose algorithms (e.g., sorting or filtering)

## Usage :

The `utils` directory is typically focused on individual, self-contained utility functions that can be imported into various parts of your application whenever needed.
